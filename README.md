# SignalR Example

This project is a simple example of how to use the SignalR library to keep information updated in real time. This project is separated into client and server.

To run the client side go to the src/SignalRClient directory and execute:
`ng serve`

To run the server side go to the src/SignalRServer directory and execute:
`dotnet run`

To view the message sent by the server, open your browser inspector and click on the Network tab and then on the WS tab.
